In Quenya, "Nai elen siluva lyenna" means "May the stars shine on you".

### Who am I?

Welt Xing, a 1st year graduate in the School of Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing University. In Germany, "welt" means the "world". My interests include:

- Machine learning model and their implementation.
- Deep learning method and framework.
- Machine learning theory.
- Graph learning.

In [my blog](https://welts.xyz), I record what I've learned:
